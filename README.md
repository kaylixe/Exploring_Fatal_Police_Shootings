# Exploring Fatal Police Shootings through Data Visualization

While crime seems to have gone down in the last few years, the number of police related shootings seem to have been on the rise. High profile cases such the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Laq'uan McDonald in Chicago, Illinois, have not only drawn so much controversy, but also brought great attention to matters of policing within our society. The rise of movement groups such as Black Lives matter have prompted inquiries about "use of force" and whether there is bias on how police make "shoot or don't shoot" decisions. Using data, a large number of police departments and agencies have found the impetus to analyze and study the effect of race on the officers decisions - while looking at other relevant factors. Studies have shown that there is a disproportionate number of fatal shootings within minority groups. This project looks at a sample of documented fatal shootings from 2015 with regard to race and other factors that occurred during the incidents.
