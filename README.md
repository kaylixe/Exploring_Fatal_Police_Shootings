# A Visualization of Fatal Police Shootings

## Introduction

The number of people fatally shot by police has dramatically increased in the recent years, even when levels of crime have been trending downwards. In the wake of the recent protests on high profile police-involved shootings, majority of the documented victims were either a minority, unarmed, or carrying some kind of a weapon.

In 2014, the killing of Micheal Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, gave birth to a movement known as Black Lives Matter, along with an intense country-wide debate on police brutality and an increased focus on the racial devide between the police force and the communities.

When adjusted for population, data has shown that police interaction with minorities is very likely to end up fatal, compared to whites. Data collected by different agencies has made it possible to study this phenomenon and aid discussions. Initially, finding relevant data on this subject was cumbersome. Most cases were either not well documented or a vast number of them were not reported at all. The Washington Post specifically has in the recent years been compiling case by case scenarios of police-involved fatal shootings. This has been an attempt to not only aid discussions on this topic but to also help study the issue of racial-bias with regard to policing in different communities. The Washington Post tracks details about the killing, which include the race, age, gender, whether the deceased was armed, mental state of the deceased, whether the officer wore a body camera and many other attributes.

This information has been made possible by consolidating information from different police agencies, social media, local reports and other independent databases and is open to the public. This project will take a look at the data using different methods of visualization and help draw insight from the data.

It is important to note that this only reflects information from the collected data. More data would be required to come to solid conclusion.
